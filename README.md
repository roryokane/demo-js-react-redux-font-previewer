## Demonstration React/Redux app
### Font Previewer

This tiny app uses [React], [Redux], [Sass], and [Webpack] to implement an interactive webfont previewer. It was written in a few hours, just to demonstrate my knowledge of those technologies.

You can run the tests with `npm test`.

The app is built on the [React Slingshot] template. The webfonts are from [Google Fonts].
